The POSIX Standard - ISO/IEC 9945
 (IEEE Std 1003.1 - 2008/Cor 1-2013)
=============

POSIX (i.e., the 'base specification' for UNIX™, a trademark of Bell Labs, or
AT&T, or X/Open, or the Open Group, or somebody) is an open standard —
or so they tell me, anyway. Trouble is, it is awfully hard to get ahold of the
standard itself, considering how 'open' it is. If you've tried to find it yourself,
you've probably wound up on here on the [IEEE website](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6506091), where
they will gladly let you download a PDF for the low, low price of $500USD,
or [here](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799), at the Open Group's slick troff-to-html website — make sure you version of Netscape Navigator has frames support!

Frustrating. But don't worry, you _can_ get a copy of the standard proper, without
having to shell out. It took me an absurd amount of time to figure this out, so I thought I'd share it, maybe save someone a bit of grief.

Basically, to access the standard, you have to actually **join** the 'Austin Group', i.e., the ISO/IEEE joint working group responsible for drafting the specification. You can do this online, if you know where to look.
1. Create an account at the Open Group website, (here)[https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/common/createIndividual.html]
2. Log in at their 'collaboration system' [page](https://collaboration.opengroup.org/operational/portal.php). From the menu on the left, click 'Manage My Activities'.
3. At the bottom of the page, under Public Projects, you'll see _The Austin Group_. Click the link below to 'join the activity'. Continue through, then
4. Go to (http://www.opengroup.org/austin/login.html) and accept their conditions.
5. At last! A link! It's password protected. Use the login you've just created. (If you haven't completed all the steps above successfully, you're password will be rejected; go back and make you're actually 'joined the activity', etc.)

While technically a "draft", this is the full, final standard (I've confirmed this).

The actual direct link is at the cryptic URL:
(https://www.opengroup.org/austin/restricted/issue8-tc1/C138.pdf).

If going through the steps above is just too onerous a task for you, it seems like there are a couple of logins (at the time of this writing) on bugmenot.com that
work... and for some reason, using 'github' for the username and password seems to work too.

It's page turner, ladies and gents — enjoy yourself appx. 4000 pages of edge-of-your-seat operating system minutia.
